        <p>&nbsp;Steve Jobs was a visionary American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur, best known for co-founding Apple Inc., where he played a pivotal role in revolutionizing modern technology. Born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, Jobs was adopted shortly after birth and raised in Mountain View, California. His early life was marked by curiosity and creativity, particularly in electronics, which he explored with his adoptive father in their garage. Despite facing challenges in traditional education, Jobs excelled in innovation, ultimately leading to the establishment of Apple Computer Inc. in 1976 with Steve Wozniak.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;Jobs’ tenure at Apple was characterized by groundbreaking product innovations like the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, which reshaped industries and consumer technology. After a brief departure from the company in 1985, during which he founded NeXT and acquired Pixar, Jobs returned to Apple in 1997 to revitalize the brand. His return marked a new era of success for Apple, turning it into a leading technology powerhouse. Jobs was not only an icon of entrepreneurship but also a figure known for his intense passion for perfection and design, leaving an indelible mark on the world when he passed away on October 5, 2011.</p></td>

      <p>&nbsp;In 1976, at the age of 21, Steve Jobs and his partner Steve Wozniak embarked on an entrepreneurial journey, co-founding Apple Computer Inc. in the modest setting of Jobs' family garage. They funded their innovative venture by selling personal belongings—Jobs sold his Volkswagen bus while Wozniak parted with his prized scientific calculator. The duo revolutionized the computer industry, introducing user-friendly personal computers that made technology accessible to the general public. Their first product, the Apple I, garnered significant attention, achieving sales of around $774,000, while the subsequent Apple II secured the company a staggering $139 million in revenue. </p></td>
